/**
 * Regression test for the SEQLESS-transcript render loop (React #301,
 * "too many re-renders") in TranscriptView.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE: the progressive-window anchor is a SEQ (`windowAnchorSeq`), derived
 * during render from the entries. `seq` is OPTIONAL on a TranscriptEntry --
 * undefined on entries read from raw JSONL before the broker's cache-insert
 * stamps it (protocol.ts), and the control panel does receive such entries
 * (use-websocket-handlers dedupes on `e.seq === undefined`). When the window
 * BOUNDARY entry (entries[len - WINDOW_SIZE]) had no seq, defaultAnchorSeq
 * returned null. The re-anchor branch fires while `follow` is on, the transcript
 * is past the window threshold, and `windowAnchorSeq === null`: it called
 * setWindowAnchorSeq(null), which left the anchor null, so the same branch
 * re-fired on the next render-phase pass -- forever -- until React threw #301.
 *
 * FIX (two parts):
 *  1. defaultAnchorSeq scans FORWARD from the ideal boundary for the nearest
 *     entry that carries a seq (never widening past WINDOW_SIZE), so a window
 *     still anchors when only SOME entries are seqless; returns null only when
 *     no entry from the boundary onward has a seq.
 *  2. A render-phase convergence guard (reanchorTo) only calls the setter when
 *     the anchor actually changes -- so even the all-seqless case (target stays
 *     null) cannot re-arm React's render-phase update.
 *
 * The render-level assertion is just "mounting does not throw": with the bug,
 * render() throws #301 synchronously; with the fix it renders cleanly.
