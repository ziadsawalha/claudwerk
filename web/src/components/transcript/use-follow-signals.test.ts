/**
 * Regression tests for the 2026-06-10 follow-state oscillator: a layout-driven
 * drift=0 scroll event ENGAGED follow during a backfill, which triggered the
 * deferred prune-collapse, whose height shrink fired a bogus DISENGAGE, which
 * re-armed the backfill -- bouncing top/bottom with zero user input. The fix is
 * the layout-stability gate in classifyFollowTransition: the bogus ENGAGE
 * (drift < 40, no proof of intent) is suppressed during a size change or
 * in-flight backfill.
 *
 * DISENGAGE is deliberately NOT suppressed: it requires real user input
 * (userScrolling) + drift > 120, which is proof of intent. Suppressing it
 * during a backfill deadlocked scroll-up-to-read-history (2026-06-25) -- the
 * disengage's veto was only ever a downstream symptom of the bogus ENGAGE,
 * which stays gated, so removing it cannot revive the oscillator.
