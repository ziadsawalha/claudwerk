/**
 * Regression test for the "Edit re-renders and re-applies diff coloring on
 * every transcript entry update" perf bug.
 *
 * The Edit diff is produced by renderEdit (tool-cases-core.tsx). When the tool
 * result carries no precomputed `structuredPatch`, renderEdit historically
 * called `structuredPatch()` (the `diff` lib) INSIDE the render body and handed
 * DiffView a brand-new `hunks` array every render -- which both recomputed the
 * O(file) diff AND busted DiffView's memo (re-tokenize via Shiki). So any
 * re-render of the (memoized) ToolLine re-ran the whole diff and re-coloured it.
 *
 * Two probes:
 *   - `structuredPatch` spy  -> how often the diff is recomputed.
 *   - DiffView render counter -> how often the coloured diff is re-rendered.
 *
 * Expected after the fix:
 *   - initial render -> 1 compute, 1 DiffView render.
 *   - re-render with identical props -> still 1 (ToolLine memo holds).
 *   - re-render that BUSTS ToolLine's memo (subagents ref churn -- a real live
 *     vector) -> still 1: the compute + the patches array must be memoized
 *     below the ToolLine memo boundary so a legit re-render is cheap.
 *
 * DiffView is mocked to a no-op counter: it strips the async Shiki highlight
 * effect (a test-env cleanup hazard) and gives a direct "diff re-coloured" count
 * while preserving DiffView's memo semantics (the fix relies on a stable
 * `patches` ref reaching it).
