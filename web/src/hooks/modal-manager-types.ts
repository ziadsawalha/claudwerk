/**
 * Unified minimizable modals — shared types.
 *
 * Every managed modal is tagged on two axes: an OWNER SCOPE (what context it
 * belongs to, which drives restore-warps-to-owner) and a MINIMIZE POLICY
 * (`minimizable` -> parkable; otherwise blocking). See plan-unified-modals.md.
 *
 * PRESENTATION is the single axis for WHERE the body renders right now --
 * `inline` (Radix Dialog in the main tab), `docked` (parked to the dock, body
 * still mounted), or `detached` (portaled into its own OS window via the
 * PopoutWindow primitive). It subsumes the old open/minimized phase plus detach;
 * `maximized` stays orthogonal and only matters when `inline`.
