/**
 * THE STATUS — the Stop-hook set_status nudge.
 *
 * A backstop that reminds the agent to leave a triage signal when it forgets, but
 * deliberately MODERATED so small steps and chatter don't get nagged:
 *  - `trackStatusTurn` keeps per-turn counters (reset each user turn; count tool
 *    use + flag file mutation on PreToolUse).
 *  - `computeStatusNudge` only fires when the turn was SUBSTANTIAL (a file
 *    mutation, or a busy multi-tool turn) and no status was set — and even then
 *    the nudge is non-coercive: it asks the agent to make the subjective call
 *    (set a status OR just end the turn). Small read/lookup/chatter turns and
 *    one-off commands are never nudged.
