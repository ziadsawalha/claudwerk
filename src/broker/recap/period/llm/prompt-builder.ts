  ## TL;DR
  3-5 bullets, the most important things from the period

  ## Features shipped
  Bulleted, link conversations via [text](/sessions/conv_xxx...), cite commits

  ## Bug fixes
  Bulleted, with commit hashes (short form)

  ## Refactors / cleanup

  ## Decisions
  Non-obvious decisions made this period and WHY -- the reasoning a diff cannot
  show. Cite the conversation where it was decided. Omit the section if none.

  ## Dead ends
  Approaches tried this period and ABANDONED, each with the reason it failed.
  git keeps no record of abandoned work -- this is high-value. Omit if none.

  ## Gotchas
  Constraints or landmines discovered: a tool that misbehaves, an environment
  quirk, a surprising failure mode. Omit the section if none.

  ## Frustrations
  Where the user hit friction and said so: things that broke repeatedly, time
  sunk fighting tooling, decisions relitigated, "why is this still happening".
  Quote or closely paraphrase the user and cite the conversation. This is the
  pain signal that feeds process fixes -- be honest, do not sanitise. Omit if none.

  ## Incidents / errors
  (omit section if none)

  ## Open questions / unresolved
  CRITICAL SECTION. List every conversation in the input's OPEN_QUESTIONS
  block with the unanswered question(s) the assistant left for the user.
  Group by conversation. Surface anything that was waiting on a user
  decision and never got one. Do not invent open questions; only use
  ones present in the input.

  ## Loose ends -- forgotten threads
  Invested conversations from BEFORE this period that were abandoned mid-work,
  each left on a question you never answered -- work you may have forgotten you
  started. Render EVERY thread in the FORGOTTEN_THREADS input as a bullet:
  link it via [short label](/sessions/conv_xxx...), state how long it's been
  idle and its turn count, and write a one-line synthesis of what it was about
  (use the title if present, else infer a label from LAST USER / LEFT AT). Lead
  with the open question that was left hanging. Most-invested first. This is the
  "you forgot this existed" section -- omit only if FORGOTTEN_THREADS is empty.

  ## Tasks completed
  Project board items closed in the period

  ## Notable conversations
  Top 3-5 by length/intensity, with links

DO NOT regenerate the cost/token table -- it's inserted programmatically.
DO NOT include greetings, sign-offs, or the H1 title (templated).
Be concrete. Use the project's actual terms verbatim.`

export const AGENT_BODY_SPEC = `MARKDOWN BODY (after the closing --- of frontmatter):

  ## TL;DR
  One or two lines. The single most important thing a fresh agent must know
  before it touches this project.

  ## State
  What is TRUE RIGHT NOW. Prioritise: work in flight that is NOT yet
  committed (a fresh agent may collide with another agent mid-edit),
  half-finished refactors, which branch is hot, what just shipped that the
  reader should build ON rather than redo. Facts from commits and closed
  tasks stated plainly; transcript-derived state tagged [inferred].

  ## Decisions
  Non-obvious decisions made this period and WHY -- the reasoning a diff
  cannot show. This is what stops the reader relitigating or contradicting
  a settled choice. Cite the conversation where it was decided.

  ## Dead ends -- do NOT retry
  Approaches that were tried and ABANDONED, each with the reason it failed.
  git keeps no record of abandoned work -- this section is the brief's
  highest-value content and exists nowhere else. Omit the section only if
  the input genuinely shows no abandoned approach.

  ## Open questions
  Unresolved questions the assistant left for the user that never got an
  answer. Use the OPEN_QUESTIONS input block VERBATIM -- do not invent.
  Group by conversation.

  ## Gotchas
  Constraints or landmines discovered this period: a tool that misbehaves,
  an environment quirk, a non-obvious dependency, a surprising failure
  mode. Only include something that would actually bite the reader.

  ## Forgotten -- may want to resume
  Invested conversations from BEFORE this period, abandoned mid-work and left on
  a question the user never answered. Render EVERY thread in the
  FORGOTTEN_THREADS input: link it (/sessions/conv_xxx...), give idle-age + turn
  count, a one-line synthesis of what it was about (title if present, else infer
  from LAST USER / LEFT AT), and the open question it stalled on. These are
  candidate work to RESUME -- the user may not remember they exist. Omit the
  section only if FORGOTTEN_THREADS is empty.

  ## Pick up here
  The obvious next actions, most important first. If there is genuinely
  nothing pending, say so in a single line.

DO NOT include greetings, sign-offs, an H1 title, or a cost table.
DO NOT pad. Use the project's actual terms verbatim.`

    \`inferred: true\`, or [inferred] in prose). Never dress inference as fact.

 */
function agentSystemPrompt(inputs: PromptInputs): string {

covering ${inputs.periodHuman} (${inputs.periodIsoRange}).

THE READER IS NOT A HUMAN. It is a fresh Claude Code agent session with zero
prior context, about to do real work in this project. It reads this brief
once, then acts. Every line costs the reader context budget and may change
what it does next. Write for that reader and no other.

THE BAR -- apply to every single bullet:
  "Would a fresh agent do something DIFFERENT because of this line?"
  If no -- DELETE the line. A short brief that is all signal beats a
  complete one padded with noise. Target: body under ~400 words.

GROUND RULES:
  - FACT vs INFERENCE. A claim backed by a commit hash or a closed task is
    a FACT -- state it plainly. A claim concluded from transcript text is
    an INFERENCE -- prefix it literally with "[inferred]". NEVER present
    inference as fact. The reader will act on this; a confident wrong claim
    is the worst output you can produce.
  - CITE EVERYTHING. Every claim names its source: commit hash (7 char),
    conversation id (8 char), or task name. A claim with no citation and no
    [inferred] tag does not belong here -- drop it.
  - NO NARRATIVE. Do not tell the story of the period. State what is TRUE
    NOW and what to DO NEXT.
  - The reader already has 'git log'. Do NOT reproduce a commit changelog.
    Mention a commit ONLY when the WHY behind it is not visible in its diff.
  - OMIT empty sections entirely. Never write a section just to say "none".
