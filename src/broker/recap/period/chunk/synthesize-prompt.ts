/**
 * CHUNKED:Final -- the reduce/synthesis stage prompt (Pillar A).
 *
 * Input: the MERGED, code-deduped facts (one RecapMetadata) from every chunk's
 * map output. Job: judgment + prose -- collapse near-duplicates the code merge
 * missed, then write the human/agent narrative body. This is the ONLY chunked
 * stage that does synthesis, and it runs on Opus (the strongest judgment).
 *
 * CRITICAL: the output must round-trip parseRecapOutput -- a YAML frontmatter
 * block between --- lines followed by the markdown body, in the EXACT contract
 * the oneshot path uses (FRONTMATTER_SPEC + body spec shared from prompt-builder),
 * so the rest of the pipeline (renderFinalMarkdown/digest/FTS) is untouched.

The facts below were already EXTRACTED from the period's transcripts in parallel
(map stage) and MERGED + de-duplicated IN CODE. Your job is JUDGMENT and PROSE,
NOT extraction:
  - REFINE the merged items: collapse near-duplicates the code merge missed
    (same thing, different wording), keep the most specific title, merge details.
  - PRESERVE every citation (conversation ids, commit hashes) and every
    "inferred" flag exactly as given -- never upgrade an inference to a fact.
  - DO NOT invent items, citations, or facts that are not in the merged input
    OR the FORGOTTEN_THREADS block below (the latter is authoritative,
    deterministic data -- render it, don't second-guess it).
    You have no transcripts here; everything else you state must trace to the input.
  - DROP anything genuinely empty; never pad to fill a section.

Output format: a YAML frontmatter block (between --- lines) followed by the
markdown body. The frontmatter is parsed and indexed -- carry the merged facts
into it faithfully.
