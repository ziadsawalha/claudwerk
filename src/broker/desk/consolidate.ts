/**
 * The CONSOLIDATION FOLD -- the LLM side of the living-history phase-out policy.
 *
 * `living-history.ts` owns the POLICY (`shouldConsolidate`: 1h horizon, ≤10min
 * interval, size valve, short-circuit). THIS is the action the policy authorizes:
 * take the dialogue turns that aged past the phase-out horizon, fold their durable
 * substance into the rolling `<memory>` block, and DROP them from the raw history.
 * That is how the context shrinks as it ages -- old turns become a few lines of
 * memory instead of verbatim transcript.
 *
 * Pure-ish: the LLM call is injected as a `ChatFn`, so this is unit-testable with
 * a stub. On any LLM failure we keep BOTH the existing memory and the aged turns
 * (no regression, no silent loss) -- a later tick retries the fold.
 *
 * Model is configurable (§5): the live fold defaults to a cheap tier; the §8
 * experiments decide whether Haiku is accurate enough or the fold needs Opus.
