/**
 * Live entrypoint for the dispatcher AGENT loop (plan-dispatcher-build.md §11).

 * Assembles the broker-control toolset + near-memory thread tools, runs the
 * bounded loop (agent.ts) on the user's intent, streams each tool call/result
 * out via the injected emitters, and packages the outcome as a DispatchDecision
 * (disposition `converse` -- the agent ANSWERED, having taken whatever control
 * actions it chose). The dispatcher is a CONTROLLER, not a chat agent.
