/**
 * SOTU git-fabric scan scheduler (Phase 2) -- the derived-state floor.
 *
 * The integration ladder is part of the ALWAYS-ON free floor (zero-LLM): it
 * MEASURES whether work integrated (so the decay engine can collapse landed work)
 * and ESCALATES at-risk/unpushed/stalled work. This module is the broker-side
 * trigger: it watches the desk-event bus and, debounced per project, asks the
 * sentinel to run the ladder (boundary: the broker never touches the host FS) and
 * appends the snapshot as a `git_scan` contribution via the same chokepoint the
 * lifecycle floor uses.
 *
 * Debounce: a trailing settle timer coalesces bursts, and a MIN_INTERVAL floor
 * caps how often any one project is scanned (the ladder is cheap, but a 7-15
 * agent fleet would otherwise hammer it). The scan itself is silent and free;
 * only the Phase-4 distill that consumes it is budget-gated.
