/**
 * SOTU (State of the Union) domain types.
 *
 * SOTU is a per-project + fleet, auto-maintained, decaying briefing -- the
 * "where are we / where do I look" narrative. The full design lives in
 * `.claude/docs/plan-state-of-union.md`.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   LAYER 1  CONTRIBUTIONS -- raw, free, no-LLM append-only queue (this file's
 *            `Contribution` union). Four sources: callouts (declared intent),
 *            turn-digests (per-turn baseline), git-scans (derived state),
 *            lifecycle (spawn/exit/...). Yields the live soft-lock map alone.
 *   LAYER 2  CHRONICLE -- the distilled narrative (`Chronicle`), regenerated
 *            lazily by the scribe/reconcile fold (Phase 4). Budget-gated.
 *
 * Phase 0 defines the shapes + the file-store that persists them; the handlers,
 * git scan, and distill engine that PRODUCE them land in later phases.
 *
 * Boundary: every id here is a broker-owned conversation id, NEVER ccSessionId.

// The callout/claim shapes AND the git-fabric shapes are the WIRE contract -- they
// live in `src/shared/protocol.ts` (the single source of truth) and are re-exported
// here so the broker module consumes them without duplicating the union. `scribe_note`
// carries the callout fields; `git_fabric_result` carries the GitFabric snapshot.
import type { CalloutType, Chronicle, ContribWeight, GitFabric, ScribeNoteTarget } from '../../shared/protocol'

// GitFabric is consumed here (GitScanContrib wraps it). Its member types
// (BranchFabric / IntegrationStatus / GitAlert) are re-exported as their broker
// consumers land (Phase 4 decay reads integration + alerts; Phase 6 renders them) --
// grows-per-phase, so the fallow dead-export gate stays green. The sentinel ladder
// imports those member types straight from `../shared/protocol`.
// Chronicle / ChronicleEntry are now part of the wire contract (the read surfaces
// serve them) -- defined in protocol.ts, re-exported here; this module owns the
// helpers (emptyChronicle) + the pipeline-version constant.
