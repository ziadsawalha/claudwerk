/**
 * SOTU fleet rollup (Phase 6) -- ENRICHES the existing Sheaf fleet view; it does
 * NOT build a parallel panel. Sheaf already renders the structural fleet (per-
 * project sections, spawn forest, cost/token rollups); this folds SOTU's
 * narrative + git-fabric INTO that structure:
 *
 *   - per project: the distilled narrative (paid, opt-in), the free floor (git
 *     escalation alerts + CONTENDED count), the per-branch/worktree merge-risk,
 *     and the citation-grounding metric;
 *   - the formerly-dead `commits` column is finished from the git-fabric scan
 *     (ahead-of-origin commits per worktree branch -- SOTU Phase 2 IS the git
 *     attribution Sheaf's "phase 3" never built);
 *   - a cheap, zero-LLM FLEET UNION across the projects the viewer can see.
 *
 * PERMISSION COVENANT (OPEN ITEM #2, a HARD gate): the fleet aggregate crosses
 * projects, so a viewer with access to project A must NEVER see project B's
 * chronicle bleed through. `canViewProject` is applied server-side BEFORE any
 * SOTU data is attached: a project the viewer cannot see gets NO `sotu` block and
 * is excluded from the union (and counted in `filteredProjects`, never silently
 * dropped). The structural Sheaf grid keeps its own (admin) gate at the route.
