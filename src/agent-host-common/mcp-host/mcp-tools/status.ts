const DESCRIPTION = `Report what THIS conversation is doing, so the user can triage many conversations at a glance. The control panel shows ONE badge per conversation keyed off \`state\`; the text fields are detail shown on expand. Call this when your state meaningfully changes (you start real work, you finish, you get stuck, you need the user) — not on every message.

\`state\` (REQUIRED) is the one signal that matters:
- \`working\`  — actively doing the task. (This is also the default at the start of every turn; you don't need to set it just to confirm you're working, but do set it if you want to show progress detail.)
- \`done\`     — the task the user asked for is COMPLETE. Nothing remains that blocks completion.
- \`needs_you\` — you are blocked ON THE USER: a decision, an answer, an approval. Prefer opening a real dialog / AskUserQuestion / ExitPlanMode for this — that's what escalates to the user's phone. A bare \`needs_you\` shows the badge but does not buzz them.
- \`blocked\`  — you are stuck on something NOT the user's to fix (a failing build, a missing credential, a dead end) and cannot proceed.

The text fields are ALL OPTIONAL. Empty is signal: a fully-finished task is \`state:'done'\` with one line in \`done\` and everything else empty. NEVER manufacture content to fill them.
- \`done\`    — what you FINISHED.
- \`pending\` — what still MUST happen for this to be complete. Test: "does this BLOCK done?" If no, it is NOT pending — it's a note.
- \`caveats\` — it works, but watch X.
- \`blocked\` — what you tried and could NOT finish, and why (the error / dead-end). Not "things I chose not to do."
- \`notes\`   — FYI asides that are NOT todos. Test: "is this still true even though the task IS complete?" e.g. "didn't commit", "didn't deploy", "left the dev server running" → ALWAYS a note, never pending or blocked. Don't nag the user with routine hygiene.
- \`safe_to_close\` (boolean) — set true ONLY when this conversation is genuinely disposable: no uncommitted/unpushed work, no pending interaction, nothing the user still needs from it. It surfaces as a visible marker so the user can spot which conversations they can just close. When unsure, leave it off.`
