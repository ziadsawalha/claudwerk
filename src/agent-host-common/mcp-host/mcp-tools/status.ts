const DESCRIPTION = `Report what THIS conversation is doing, so the user can triage many conversations at a glance. The control panel shows ONE badge per conversation keyed off \`state\`; the text fields are detail shown on expand. Call this when your state meaningfully changes (you start real work, you finish, you get stuck, you need the user) — not on every message.

USE YOUR JUDGMENT — this is a subjective call. A small step, a quick lookup, a one-off command, or routine back-and-forth that does NOT change how the user would triage this conversation does NOT need a status; skip it. Reserve the call for moments that actually move the triage signal: you finished (\`done\`), you're blocked on the user (\`needs_you\`), you're stuck (\`blocked\`), or you genuinely want to surface progress detail mid-work (\`working\`). When in doubt, fewer is better — an over-reported conversation is noise.

\`state\` (REQUIRED) is the one signal that matters:
- \`working\`  — actively doing the task. (This is also the default at the start of every turn; you don't need to set it just to confirm you're working, but do set it if you want to show progress detail.)
- \`done\`     — the task the user asked for is COMPLETE. Nothing remains that blocks completion.
- \`needs_you\` — you are blocked ON THE USER: a decision, an answer, an approval. Prefer opening a real dialog / AskUserQuestion / ExitPlanMode for this — that's what escalates to the user's phone. A bare \`needs_you\` shows the badge but does not buzz them.
- \`blocked\`  — you are stuck on something NOT the user's to fix (a failing build, a missing credential, a dead end) and cannot proceed.

The text fields are ALL OPTIONAL and render as MARKDOWN in the control panel (the \`done\`/\`pending\`/etc. values support **bold**, \`code\`, links, and \`- \` bullet lists — use them when they make the handoff clearer, but keep it tight). Empty is signal: a fully-finished task is \`state:'done'\` with one line in \`done\` and everything else empty. NEVER manufacture content to fill them.
- \`done\`    — what you FINISHED.
- \`pending\` — what still MUST happen for this to be complete. Test: "does this BLOCK done?" If no, it is NOT pending — it's a note.
- \`caveats\` — it works, but watch X.
- \`blocked\` — what you tried and could NOT finish, and why (the error / dead-end). Not "things I chose not to do."
- \`notes\`   — FYI asides that are NOT todos. Test: "is this still true even though the task IS complete?" e.g. "didn't commit", "didn't deploy", "left the dev server running" → ALWAYS a note, never pending or blocked. Don't nag the user with routine hygiene.
- \`safe_to_close\` (boolean) — set true ONLY when this conversation is genuinely disposable: no uncommitted/unpushed work, no pending interaction, nothing the user still needs from it. It surfaces as a visible marker so the user can spot which conversations they can just close. When unsure, leave it off.
- \`notify\` (plain text) — USE SPARINGLY. A short one-line message that physically BUZZES the user's phone and browser right now (a real push, same as the \`notify\` tool). Set this ONLY when you genuinely need to grab their attention away from whatever they're doing — never for routine status. The badge \`state\` is the quiet signal; \`notify\` is the loud one. Most set_status calls MUST omit it. Plain text, not markdown.

THIS CALL IS THE HANDOFF. When you set \`done\`, the control panel renders it as the conversation's final, user-visible result — you do NOT need to call set_status again, and a separate written summary afterward is redundant noise. Put the substance IN the fields (they're markdown) and let the card speak. At most a single short sign-off line; never re-explain what the card already shows.`
